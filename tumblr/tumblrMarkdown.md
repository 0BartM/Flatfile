# “Afulgens” ? What ? #

Hello and welcome to my blog !

My name is Barthélémy, I am studying multimedia and communication in France and this is my blog about red pandas.

Yes, red pandas. That’s all.

The red panda (”Ailurus fulgens ”, hence the blog’s title) is a mammal which can be found in Asia, essentially in southwestern China. Ailurus fulgens rouglhy look like occidental foxes with their orange-ish fur, shaggy tail and solitary behavior.

Those animals however are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their time on trees. They mainly feed on bamboo but may also eat small animals such as birds and obviously insects. Sleeping and resting during daytime, red pandas are nocturnal: they are mostly active during the evening or night where they look for food or mark their territory.

Red pandas are very intelligent and cause no harm to human beings.

They however are threatened by human activities and the species has been classified “Endangered” by the  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Indeed, deforestation and poaching are directly threatening red pandas and only 10 000 mature wild individuals are remaining to this day.

That’s it for the short introduction ! I’ll talk more about red pandas throughout this blog and will try to regularly post content.
Let’s also hope this blog will convince you to help red pandas in their daily struggle *winks*
